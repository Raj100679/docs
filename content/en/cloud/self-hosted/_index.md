## On-premises Deployment of Layer5 Cloud

Layer5 Cloud is a collection of services that can be deployed on-premises. The following diagram illustrates the architecture of Layer5 Cloud.

## White-labeling

White-labeling is a feature that allows you to customize the appearance and branding of your engineering platform powered by Layer5 Cloud. With white-labeling, you can change the logo, color scheme, domain name, and other elements of the user interface to match your own identity and preferences. White-labeling enables you to offer a seamless and consistent experience to your customers, partners, or internal users who access your service mesh platform. White-labeling also helps you to differentiate your platform from other Layer5 Cloud users and competitors, and to enhance your brand recognition and loyalty.

## Consideration for Air-Gapped Deployments

Meshery acknowledges the importance of air-gapped deployments and ensures content support for such environments. Content registered should be available even in the absence of internet connectivity, thus aligning with Meshery's commitment to versatile deployment scenarios.
